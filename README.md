# BearrdCrash Game

## What is the BearrdCrash Game?

### _Idea and Scenario_

The BearrdCrash Game idea was built upon Crash game. 

Player should finish the cyclic route by controlling the main character - BearBirdBuddy. The criterion to compete is catching the time up. 
Additionally, user must avoid bombs, stones, fireballs and the huge hole in the center of the map. On the other hand there are coins that can be gathered during the game. 
The main criterion to finish the game is the time. Player must finish the game before countdown ends.

### _What was used?_

The game was developed by using the Babylon.js environment. The _BearBirdBuddy_, _bombs_, _coins_, _speed amplification platforms_ and _fireballs_ were built using **Babylon.js.** On the other
hand, _car_, _city_, _buildings_, _start line_ of the game was built by using **Blender** and **3ds Max**.

Animations of the game were built by **BirdAyiAuto Team** by using default rotation and translation functions of **Babylon.js** and **Physics** libraries.
